Letâ€™s start something more interesting. We are gonna talk about JCR in more details.

1.	What is a content repository? What is JCR?
2.	How to add / delete property from Node?
3.	Explain Node class methods?
4.	What is workspace?
5.	How many workspaces repository can have?
6.	How many workspaces client can work with in a single session?

For this questions please read the next documentation about JCR (1-5, 10, 13) http://www.day.com/specs/jcr/2.0/1_Preface.html

Also I want that you prepare a home work task (you can use this code as starting point https://github.com/Vedzmar/jcr_training ):

1.	Write a recursive function for print jcr tree for particular node.
2.	Create your personal workspace in repository and work with it.
3.	Write Entity class with at least 3 fields (int, String, Date/Calendar)
4.	Write DAO class for saving, reading, editing and deleting your entities from JCR repository
5.	Rewrite your program for working with already existing AEM repository (connect via http to AEM instance)

Feel free to ask me personal or in chant in case any questions/issues.
