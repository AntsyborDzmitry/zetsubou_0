Find as much as possible information about observation in JCR. You can start from this link http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2006/11/08/advanced-java-content-repository.html?page=2

As we all know JCR works not so good with flat data (a lot nodes on the same level). To decrease performance issue for this problem I propose you implement jcr listener that will separate our node entities by some rule (creation date for example) and inbox them to folder with particular month. I mean if we added employee in our repository it should be moved under node folder with name August.
Separation rule is all up to you and will depends on business logic of your entity.
Don’t forget to change your dao implementation according this rule.
