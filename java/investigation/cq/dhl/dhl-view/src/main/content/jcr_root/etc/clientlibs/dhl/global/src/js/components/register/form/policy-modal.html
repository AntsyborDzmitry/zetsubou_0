        <a name="use-cookies"></a>
        <h2>Use of Web Tracking</h2>
        <p>We use tracking software to determine how many users visit our website and how often. We do not use this software to collect individual personal data or individual IP addresses. The data are used solely in anonymous and summarized form for statistical purposes and for developing the website.</p>

        <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
        <p>"Cookies" are small files that enable us to store information related to your PC and you, the user, specifically, while you visit one of our websites. Cookies help us to determine how frequently our internet pages are accessed as well as the number of users.

        <p>On the one hand, we use what are called "session cookies", those that are stored exclusively for the duration of your visit to one of our internet pages. On the other, we use "persistent cookies" for retaining information about visitors who repeatedly access one of our internet pages. The purpose of using cookies is to be able to offer you optimal user guidance as well as to "recognize" you and thus be able to present (as much as possible) diversified internet pages and new contents during repeated use. </p>
        <b><p>Generally, we do not create an individual profile of your online activities. The content of a persistent cookie is limited to an identification number. Name, email address, IP address, etc., are not saved on the majority of our sites. </p></b>

        <p>Should you choose not to sign up for email marketing updates, you will not be contacted in the future and your email address will only be used confidentially by DHL internally to understand your individual online activities.

        <h2>Cookie Categories</h2>
        <p>All cookies in the table above have been categorized according to 4 numbered groups - the relevant category numbers are listed in column 1. Please note that cookies can belong to more than one category.</p>
        <p>The categories are as follows:</p>
        <p>[1] Strictly Necessary: These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features. Without these cookies, services you have asked for cannot be provided.</p>
        <p>[2] Performance: These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website, for instance which pages visitors go to most often. These cookies don't collect information that identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how a website works.</p>
        <p>[3] Functionality: These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make and provide enhanced, more personal features. For example, these cookies can be used to remember and store the last tracking number that you entered when using a tracking application. Information these cookies collect may be anonymized and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.</p>
        <p>[4] Targeting or Advertising: These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests.

        <h2>Use of nugg.ad Cookies</h2>
        <p>This website uses <a target="_blank" href="https://nugg.ad/en/index">nugg.ad AG</a> technology to monitor data on controlling advertising. In order to do this, nugg.ad saves the frequency of use of various website topics in the form of cookies. These cookies are stored in the browser of your device (e.g. PC, laptop, smart phone etc.) for a maximum period of 26 weeks. nugg.ad's technology may also save basic information on your use of other websites in order to estimate what advertising might interest you the most. It is not possible for us to trace any information in the cookies back to individual users. In particular we cannot identify a person by name, address or any other data that is directly identifying.</p>
        <p>If you would like to see advertising on websites that are of interest to you, then you can opt in to receive a further theme-based analysis of your usage behavior. If you give your agreement, then this opt-in cookie will also be stored in the browser of your device. It will be stored for 1 year. If previously collected nugg.ad cookies are present in the browser of your device, by setting the opt-in cookie the following will happen: with your permission the nugg.ad cookie lifespan is lengthened to 1 year (calculated from the moment the cookie is set). Information stored in nugg.ad cookies prior to opt-in is retained and will be deleted upon expiration of the cookie (maximum 1 year).
        You have the right to prevent the recording of information by the nugg.ad system at any time by exercising your right to opt out. If you have already given your consent, you can also cancel it at any time, effective thereafter. An opt-out will also be stored in a cookie in your browser's device with a lifespan of 10 years, it will be named "nuggstopp", and will be set by "nuggad.net".</p>

        <h2>Use of Adcloud Cookie</h2>
        <p>As you browse DHL websites, we use Adcloud technology to place an advertising cookie in the browser of your device (e.g. PC, laptop, smart phone etc.) so that we can understand what you are interested in. The cookie lasts for a maximum period of 365 days and enables us to present you with advertising on other sites based on your previous interaction with DHL websites. Although we collect data based on keywords to display the right ads to you on other websites, it is not possible for us to trace any information in the cookie back to you as an individual. In particular we cannot identify a person by name, address or any other data that is directly identifying. This website also uses Adcloud technology to monitor advertising campaigns.</p>
        <p>If you want Adcloud to stop tracking you, you can learn how to do this under 'How to Manage Cookies' below.</p>

        <h2>Sharing Tools: Third Party Cookies</h2>
        <p>DHL now uses embedded 'share' buttons on its websites. These make it easy for visitors to bookmark and share content through their favourite social networks. When you click on one of these buttons, a cookie may be set by the service you have chosen to share content through. DHL does not control the use of these cookies and you should therefore check the relevant third party's website for more information. The 'share buttons' are provided by AddThis. For more information about their data collection practices, please take a look at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.addthis.com/tos">AddThis Privacy Policy</a></p>

        <h2>Third Party Cookies in embedded content</h2>
        <p>Please note that on some pages of our websites you may notice that cookies have been set that are not related to DHL. When you visit a page with content embedded from, for example, YouTube or Vimeo, these service providers may set their own cookies on your web browser. DHL does not control the use of these cookies and cannot access them due to the way that cookies work, as cookies can only be accessed by the party who originally set them. You should check the third party websites for more information about these cookies.</p>

        <h2>Web Beacons</h2>
        <p>In order to keep DHL's online content relevant, easy to use and up-to-date, we use web analytics services such as Webtrends* to help us understand how people use our websites. These services use data collection technologies such as web beacons. Web beacons are small electronic images that deliver cookies, count visits, and understand usage and website effectiveness. In turn, this lets us know what content is of interest to our visitors and helps us provide tailored information on our websites. These web beacons are anonymous and do not contain or collect any information that identifies you.
        The information is anonymous and only used for statistical purposes. Web analytics data and cookies cannot be used to identify you as they never contain personal information such as your name or email address.</p>
        <p>* See Webtrends entry in DHL Table of Cookies above for more information.</p>
